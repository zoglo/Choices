[#912](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/912) [#567](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/567) [#843](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/843)

## [11.0.0 RC2] (2024-08-03)

## [11.0.0 RC1] (2024-08-02)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* `allowHtml` now defaults to false.
* HTML escaping of choice/item labels should no longer double escape depending on allowHTML mode.
* Templates/text functions now escape `'` characters for display.
* `addItemText`/`uniqueItemText`/`customAddItemText` are now called with the `value` argument already escaped.
* Typescript classes for input data vs internal working data have been adjusted resulting in the `Choice`/`Group`/`Item` typescript classes have been renamed, and aliases left as required.

### Features

* `config.classNames` now accept arrays to support multiple classes. [#1121](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/1121) [#1074](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/1074) [#907](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/907) [#832](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/832)
* The original option list for the select is not destroyed, and all loaded choices are serialised to HTML for better compatibility with external javascript. [#1053](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/1053) [#1023](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/1023)
* New `singleModeForMultiSelect` feature to treat a `select-single` as if it was a `select-multiple` with a max item count of `1`, and still auto-close the dropdown and swap the active item on selection. [#1136](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/1136) [#904](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/904)
* Remove `deepMerge` dependency.
* `Remove item text` can be localized.
* Allow user-created choices for selects. [#1117](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/1117) [#1114](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/1114)
    * User input is escaped by default. At the risk of XSS attacks this can be disabled by `allowHtmlUserInput`.
* Render options without a group even if groups are present. [#615](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/615) [#1110](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/1110)
* Read `data-labelclass`/`data-label-description` from `<option>` HTML to drive adding a per-choice CSS label and description text when `allowHtml: false`.
* Add `removeItemButtonAlignLeft` option, to control if the remove item button is at the start or the end of the item.
* Add `removeChoice` method. Removes the choice from the `choices.js` object and any backing `<option>` HTML element
* Add `refresh` method. Reloads choices from the backing `<select>`s options.
* Improve rendering performance by batching changes.
* `escapeForTemplate` function is passed to the 2nd method of the `callbackOnCreateTemplates` callback.
* When `allowHtml` is false, default templates now render escaped html to `innerHtml` writing to `innerText`.
    * This provides consistent rendering performance as `innerText` is quirky and slower than escaped html into `innerHtml`
* Shadow DOM support [#938](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/pull/938)

* Fix various "first press" bugs on single select dropdowns. [#1104](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/1104)

* Fix 'remove item' button would trigger the change event twice due to placeholder value being used (match html single-select). [#892](https://github.com/Choices-js/Choices/issues/892)
